# SyncodeMath
This project uses the Syncode library with the microsoft/phi-2 LLM to parse natural language arithmetic queries into structured JSON, extracting operands and operators. It then computes the arithmetic results, demonstrating grammar-guided inference for reliable structured data extraction and processing.
